This application is the user interface for READ (Reposit√≥rio Eletr√¥nico de Arquivos e Documentos), an Electronic Document Management System (EDMS) developed for the Department of Applied Informatics (DIA) at the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UNIRIO).\
The system allows users to store, search and retrieve documents with permission management and separation of department files.
